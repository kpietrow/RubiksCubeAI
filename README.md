# RubiksCubeAI

Hello! 

If you are here looking at my distinguished Rubik's cube solver, then I bid you welcome!

The RubiksCubeAI/rubik2 folder holds the finalized source code. The Solve.java file is what can take in a Rubik's cube state, and return the steps needed to solve it. It currently works for depths of 7 easily, 8 on most occasions, with any higher being unreliable at this time. 

The rubik2 folder also contains its own README, which details how I represented the state of each cube. 

Thank you!
