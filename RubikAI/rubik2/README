The corner cubie list:
// { R Y G }, { B Y R }, { O Y B }, { G Y O }, { O W G }, { B W O }, { R W B }, { G W R }
private int[][] validCorners = {{0, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 0}, {4, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {4, 5, 1}, {3, 5, 4}, {0, 5, 3}, {1, 5, 0}};
	
The edge cubie list: 
// { R W }, { R B }, { R Y }, { R G }, { G Y }, { G O }, { G W }, { B Y }, { O Y }, { B W }, { B O }, { O W }
private int[][] validEdges = {{0, 5}, {0, 3}, {0, 2}, {0, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {3, 2}, {4, 2}, {3, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}};

The value of the colors:
[R, G, Y, B, O, W]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

	
It should be noted, that the corner cubies are based around the White and Yellow sides. The orientation of a cubie is determined by where the 
White or Yellow side falls in each cubie position. For example, if the { B W R } cubie is occupying the position of the { R Y B } cubie, and the 
order of the { B W R } cubie is { W B R }, then that cubie will have an orientation of 1, as the W side (moving to the right in the array) is one 
position from the center. If it was { R B W }, then the orientation would be 2.

For the edges, it is based on the same general idea, with the rule being that the first cubie should have the lower value. For example, if the { Y B } 
cubie is occupying the spot of the { R W } cubie with an order of { B Y }, then that cubie's orientation is 1. It should be noted that cubies { B Y } and 
{ O Y } are exceptions to this rule, the reasoning being that W and Y sides should always be secondary. These two exceptions are accounted for when initial 
orientation is determined.


The structure of the corner cubie BitSets:
	4 2 1 | 2 1
The first three bits denote which cubie in the global list of corner cubies it is. The second two bits denote the orientation (or lack thereof if none 
are flipped). 

The structure of the edge cubie BitSets:
	8 4 2 1 | 1
The first four bits denote which cubie in the global list of corner cubies it is. The second bit denotes the orientation.

The BitSet[] of the state of the cube is ordered, with the list of the 8 corner cubies being first, followed by the list of the 12 edge cubies.
Both the list of corner cubies and edge cubies is sorted by their positions on the 'validCorners' and 'validEdges' arrays. For instance, even though
the first corner { R Y G } may not actually contain those colors, it will contain the colors of the sides occupying that corner.
